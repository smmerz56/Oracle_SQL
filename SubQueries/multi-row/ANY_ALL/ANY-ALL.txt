ANY-
Compare a value returned from each value of the subquery.
Less than ANY means less than the maximum. Greater than ANY means more than the minimum.
= ANY is the equivalent to the IN keyword.

ALL-
Compares a value to all values returned from the subquery.
Greater than ALL means more than the maximum. Less than ALL means less than the minimum.


How I think of ANY/ALL:
ANY compares each and every record returned. 
ALL compares to what I think of as the one entity returned.
 

NOT can be used with IN, ANY, and ALL operators
